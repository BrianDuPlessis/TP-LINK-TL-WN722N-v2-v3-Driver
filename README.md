This document contains the linux commands neccesary to download the 
drivers needed by the wifi adapter(TP LINK TL-WN722N V2/V3) to enter

The bash commands contained in the first part of the document 
is more applicable to older versions of kali, however, a 
new section (Kali linux 2023.2a) has been added, which makes this 
process significantly easier on the newest distrobution of Kali Linux.
